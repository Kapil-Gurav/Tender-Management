# Tender Management System

## Abstract
- Project developed to enable vendors to get all tender details online and provide the facility to submit the tender.
- Provides a system to reduce extra costs involved in the process such as:
  - Advertising
  - Document processing
  - Getting confirmation results
- Vendors can save a lot of time. This application ensures the evaluation process is completed within the assigned date.
- Different vendors provide different bids, among which selected bids can be approved.

## Existing System

- Contractors need to submit their documents by visiting the office or centers on time.
- Contractors have to bid for particular tenders on time by applying forms and waiting for approval replies.
- The admin needs to post the projects or contracts as posters or advertisements regularly.
- It takes a long time to access tenders or vendors' data.

## Proposed System
- Users need to have a network connection.
- New users need to register as new vendors on the website.
- Contractors can log in and bid for existing tenders.
- They need to log in using their login-id and password used during registration.
- To reduce paperwork, data available online can be used for final decisions by the administration to contact suppliers directly.
- More data security.
- Easy access to tenders and vendors' data.
