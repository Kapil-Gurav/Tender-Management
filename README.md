## Abstract
- Project developed to enable vendors to get all tender details online and provide the facility to submit the tender.
- Provides a system to reduce extra costs involved in the process such as:
  - Advertising

- It takes a long time to access tenders or vendors' data.

## Proposed System
- Users need to have a network connection.
- New users need to register as new vendors on the website.
- Contractors can log in and bid for existing tenders.
- They need to log in using their login-id and password used during registration.
